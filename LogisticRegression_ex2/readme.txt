Implements logistic regression to classify datasets.

To run:
In octave terminal, call ex2.m. This reads data from ex2data1.txt. To run regularized version, call ex2reg.m. This reads data from ex2data2.txt.

Completed files:
- costFunction.m - Calculate cost and gradient of samples
- costFunctionReg.m - Calculate regularized cost and gradient of samples
- plotData.m - Plots data
- predict.m - Predicts classification based on sigmoid function
- sigmoid.m - Calculates logistic regression "probability" for given data
